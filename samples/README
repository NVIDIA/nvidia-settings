NV-CONTROL X Extension Samples

The `nvidia-settings` application is fairly involved, and is not
the easiest source code to read through for someone interested in
learning how to use the NV-CONTROL.

The applications in this directory are trivial examples demonstrating
how to use the NV-CONTROL X extension.  For more thorough
documentation on the extension, please see the NV-CONTROL-API.txt
document (located in the doc/ directory of the nvidia-settings
source package).

Sample applications:

    nv-control-info: demonstrates how to query for extension
                     presense, basic information.

    nv-control-dvc:  demonstrates how to query and assign an
                     integer attribute (NV_CTRL_DIGITAL_VIBRANCE); also
                     shows how to handle multiple display devices.

    nv-control-events: demonstrates how to register to receive and
                       interpret NV-CONTROL events.

    nv-control-dpy: demonstrates how to configure display devices
                    using the NV-CONTROL X extension.

    nv-control-targets: demonstrates how to query various attributes
                        from varying target types (GPUs, X Screens,
                        Frame Lock Boards) using the XNVCTRL target
                        functions.

    nv-control-framelock: demonstrates how to query frame lock related
                          attributes.  Also demonstrates how to enable/
                          disable frame lock.
