If you are adding a new banner image for an nvidia-settings page, the
image should be <= 60 pixels high (or <= 110 pixels high for the tall banner).

If I have a png, how do I build it into nvidia-settings?

    - make sure you have the gdk-pixbuf-csource binary somewhere
      in your path.

    - run './png_to_c_header.sh foo.png' This will generate the foo_pixdata.h
      header file that can then be included in the nvidia-settings source code.

    - add a foo_pixdata.h entry to the IMAGE_DATA_EXTRA_DIST variable
      in .../src.mk

    (Also follow these next steps if this image is to be used in the banner)

    - add to the BannerArtworkType enum in ctkbanner.h

    - include foo_pixdata.h in ctkbanner.c

    - add an entry to the ArtworkTable[] in ctkbanner.c:select_artwork()


NOTE: Regenerating all images can be done like so:

	for file in `ls *.png`; do ./png_to_c_header.sh $file; done
